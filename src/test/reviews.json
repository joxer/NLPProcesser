    "- 5 stops by tram to city centre - low prices - empty room with clean bed - shared but clean showers - acceptable breakfasts (except disgusting coffe) - wifi connection in a lobby You will get what you pay for. For few nights acceptable. ",
    "we had already stayed in the part of Budapest with all the attractions so it didn't bother us that the hotel was out of the way. It is a hour and a half walk and 12 minute tram ride. The staff were friendly and helpful. The rooms were comfortable clean and spacious. Very quiet at night - no street noise....  ",
    "This place is so cheap that you can't really complain about the quality. You can't expect much for $20 a night. The location is great, 45 minute walk to the centre of town or quick tram ride. I parked my motorcycle for free just outside the front door which was great. The negatives are that the wifi didn't work in... ",
    "This hotel is 10 minutes away from the center of Budapest, by public transport. The staff is polite and the private bathrooms were okay. In the room, there was a fridge and a TV (with only CNN though, the rest was in Hungarian). The beddings were okay, although there were some light traces of uncleanness. Notice that there were some flies around the room lights but they didn't bother us so that wasn't a disturbance. Breakfast is simple with coffee, some bread and jam. No lounge room or bar in the hotel (just some sofas with wifi access). It's not 100% clean, but it was definitely worth its price cos that is really cheap. If you're not too demanding and like cheap things, thats a good hotel to stay.  ",
    " Honestly, I am not one to use tripadvisor a lot but THIS is worth writing about... Simply don't step foot in here! I was with two of my friends, it was cheap so we thought we deserve a real bed and comfort after a 7 day festival! We walked in to reception to be greeted by a little man! We started the check in process, and after he looked at us as if to say...any thing else? but didn't!! we had to ask where the rooms were and can we have a key!! to which he said, 'yes the weather is nice today!' so we repeated ourselves, 'where are the rooms and could we have our key please?' to which he replied 'ahhh yes, they are clean!' WHAT!! haha. We eventually got there, walked in and jaws dropped! A list shall be made! Pubic and head hair on the walls and in the bed Lumps (we thought dead animals as I don't think rats would survive a night here) in the bed Stains on the bed Walls glued together with chewing gum A ridiculous attempt of a bathroom Double glazing consisting of literally two window (large enough to simply jump out of as I think life would be better all mangled up on the floor 4 floors down!) Dirty floors, ceilings and walls Some sort of bloodish orange colour stain on the wall As you can probably tell, we soon left. The location is awful, theres nothing around without getting a tram or taxi. Literally checked in, and checked out 2 hours later. All he said was 'oh, ok, sorry.' Not even offering a refund, which in all fairness ain't worth getting back the Â£6 per night price! So we got a taxi and went to BO18 Hotel in the centre.....ohhh my gollies....now THATS where you want to go, it was a 3 star but compared to this, it was a 6*!!!!!!!! Room Tip: Simply don't book here!!! There's soo many better places  ",
    "Breaking a rule here but paid 12 euro a night for this place so all comments must be accepted in this light.fine check in-wasn't expecting much but was pleasantly surprised by my big room with large window.just a sink but the toilet and shower was fine down the corridor.kinda nice to be about out of town but tram stops just outside the door.tescos across the road.bar to the left does good beer for 1.20 a pint.feel like you are in local Budapest.basic hotel but fine airy , plenty of space. Breakfast was okay. Clothes washing/drying facilities available too. ",
    "Stayed here for 1 night as the neighbouring hotel (griff) was fully booked. The hotel looks like it used to be a hospital and the rooms look typical back packer style. Ok if you want basic accomodaton ,2 desks , 3 single beds and a sink, and a shared shower/toilet. It's just such a shame there is no tv in the room,as it would make it more homely.having said that its great value for money if you just want a bed for the night,wifi internet in the hotel lobby. I must say all the staff were excellent.spoke great English and very helpful and knowledgeable, the only let down is the decor of the hotel.it needs to be painted cheerful colours and not just a dull white. The breakfast is very basic.bread,jam and ham,tea and coffee. The bar lady /resturant manager \"briggy\" was fantastic.I was the only one in the bar and felt a bit sad/down. But briggy lifted my spirits with her wonderful personality,it was amazing how she listened to my problems and was so understanding.briggy was wonderful at her job and very professional.I met some interesting people here and would probably book again one day.many thanks to all the staff for making my stay enjoyable ",
    "First of all - there are two hotels just next to each other - Hotel Griff, which seems to be a rather normal 3* business hotel and Hotel Griff Junior - which is a 1* hotel we stayed in. The building was (or maybe still is) a normal student dormitory - long corridors, unappealing look, communal showers and toilets. We booked a double room with en-suite bathroom - it turned out to have three separate beds. Furniture very simple to none (3 beds, 1 desk, 1 chair), bed linen and towels clean, carpet had some stains on it, bathroom although cleaned showed some signs of its age. Breakfast not very good (two types of bread, ham, cheese (only on day 1), fake vegetable oil butter, three jams, bad cofee, tea selection and hot milk - that's about it). The pros are its location (trams no. 19 and 49 stop just few meters from the hotel and take you to the centre in about 15 minutes) and frankly THE PRICE. For what would get us a bed in a backpackers hostel's dorm got us our own room with bathroom. Not complaining but wouldn't go there again. ",
    "I think that the hotel's building is from socialist era some kind of after-work sanatorium or smth like that. Nevertheless, our room had 3 beds, simple WC and douche, and even wired Internet connection. Suitable for low-budget 1-2 nights staying to look at beautiful Budapest by the whole family or the group of young friends. the car park is free and guided. Trhe breakfast was include in the price but was rather poor. "
